Project Title: Home Care Company Database

Team Members: Diana Nalivaiko, Roberto Rojas Perez, and Asal Mojtabaei

System Used: MySQL

In our Database Systems Management class, we developed a database for the Home Care Company, which provides healthcare assistance to seniors and disabled individuals. This database was designed to manage the companyâ€™s operations, including storing and tracking vital information about clients, nurses, and their interactions.

Project Overview:

The database includes the following key functionalities:

Client Information Management: Stores details about clients, such as their name, contact information, address, date of birth, and a brief description of their health conditions. Emergency contacts and prescribed medications are also tracked.
Nurse Information Management: Tracks data about nurses, including their names, contact details, Health Ministry registration numbers, and other professional credentials.
Contracts: Each client signs a contract with the company, and the database stores information about these agreements, including start and end dates.
Visit Reports: Nurses submit detailed reports after each client visit. These reports include whether the visit occurred on schedule, the client's health condition, and the services provided.
Substitute Nurses: In cases where a nurse cannot attend a scheduled visit, the system records the substitution details, including the substitute nurse's information and the duration of the substitution.
Billing and Supervision: Tracks client billing information and records hierarchical relationships among nurses, including supervisors and supervisees.

Technical Highlights:

Entity-Relationship Modeling: We created an ER diagram to represent the relationships between entities, including nurses, clients, contracts, reports, and more.
Database Normalization: The database was normalized to BCNF to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.
SQL Implementation: We wrote SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and querying information efficiently.
