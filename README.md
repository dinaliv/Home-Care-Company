# Home-Care-Company-Database
Home Care Company provides health care assistance to seniors and disabled people. Many registered nurses work for
this company. Patients (Clients) make a contract with the company. In the contract information about the client, schedule
of nurse visit at home, address of the client, phone number, brief description of the illness of the patient… is stored.
We store information about nurses too. Name, phone number, email address, Health Ministry registration number, date of
birth …
Nurses must record a report about their visit of the patient. They store in the database if they met the client on the
scheduled time, or they missed, the health condition of the client and services they provided to the client.
There is a possibility that a nurse cannot visit a client and the company substitute the nurse with another nurse for that
temporary period. We must store this information too.
For more information, check Project Report Template file.
